Flask API
===========================

A **production-ready** boilerplate built with **Python 3** and **Flask**.

On the backend, it comes pre-configured with **SQLAlchemy** for data persistence, and includes a polished integration between **Flask-RESTful** and **Flask-Marshmallow** for painless model loading and serialization. **User authentication and registration** come working out-of-the-box, thanks to a little help from **Flask-Security**.
